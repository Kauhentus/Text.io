# Text.io - Bot

A Discord Bot with various text-based features:
- Generate spam of all kinds (symbols, emojis, letters, etc.)
- Turn normal text into discord-emoji text
- Filter out a message with all sorts of weird symbols, leaving just normal letters, numbers, and symbols (ascii).
- "Creepify" text by adding diacritis (accent marks) to them. This creepification is rather light, as heavy additions of accent marks will cause Discord to filter them out.
